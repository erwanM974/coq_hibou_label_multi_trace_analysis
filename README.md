# Coq ICTSS 2020

This repository hosts a proof written in the Gallina language.
We use the Coq automated theorem prover to prove the correctness of a multi-trace oracle algorithm with regards to a formal semantics.

This proof accompanies the publication of a paper in the 2020 edition of the ICTSS conference (32ND IFIP INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TESTING SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS).

A long version of this paper is currently available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01777) on Arxiv.

An implementation (using the Rust language) of this multi-trace oracle algorithm is available on this [repository](https://github.com/erwanM974/hibou_ictss_2020).
