# Coq ICTSS 2020

This repository hosts a proof written in the Gallina language.
We use the Coq automated theorem prover to prove the correctness of a multi-trace oracle algorithm with regards to a formal semantics.
This proof accompanies the publication of a paper in the 2020 edition of the ICTSS conference (32ND IFIP INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TESTING SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS).
