# Coq proof for multi-trace analysis in HIBOU LABEL

This repository hosts a proof written in the Gallina language.
We use the Coq automated theorem prover to prove the correctness of a multi-trace oracle algorithm with regards to a formal semantics.

This proof accompanies the publication of a paper, currently available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01777) on Arxiv.

A web page (generated with coqdoc) presenting the proof can be accessed [here](https://erwanm974.github.io/coq_hibou_label_multi_trace_analysis/).

A prototype tool, which implements and extends upon this multi-trace analysis algorithm is available on [this repository](https://github.com/erwanM974/hibou_label).
